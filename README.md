# Giphy-RXN
A simple search tool for gifs using the Giphy API.

## How to Use
Click on a suggested tag or create one of your own using the search bar. Clicking on a tag will display up to 10 gifs from Giphy. Searching for a tag will automatically display relevant gifs and add that tag to your searches.

Giphy RXN has nine suggested tags with a science and technology theme to get you started, but the sky's limit.

Just kidding...
